    question: "What is a blockchain wallet?",
    answer: (
      <>
        blockchain wallet is a digital wallet used for managing and storing cryptocurrencies (such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.) and related digital assets. It allows users to securely store, send, and receive cryptocurrencies, and also interact with decentralized applications (dApps). <br />
        The main functions of a blockchain wallet include: <br /><br />
        <ul className="list-decimal pl-6">
          <li>Storing private and public keys: The private key is used to sign transactions and authorize the transfer of funds, while the public key is used to generate the user's wallet address.</li>
          <li>Sending and receiving cryptocurrencies: Users can send and receive digital currencies through wallet addresses.</li>
          <li>Checking balances and transaction history: The wallet can display the user's cryptocurrency balance and all past transactions.</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        Blockchain wallets can be categorized into different types, such as hardware wallets (cold wallets), software wallets (hot wallets), and web-based wallets, depending on how private keys are stored and the level of security.

    question: "If I lose my MERCURY Wallet, what happens to the crypto assets stored in the wallet?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Crypto assets stored in a lost wallet cannot be accessed without the private key. Therefore, when creating a wallet, it is important to create a backup of your private key and store it in a secure location. If a backup is created, the private key can be restored if the wallet is lost or damaged.
      </>

  },
  {
    id: "16",
    question: "I sent tokens to the wrong wallet address",
    answer: (
      <>
        Unless you know the owner of the wallet, tokens sent to the wrong wallet address are most likely lost forever. The MERCURY team has no way to access the funds in anyone's wallet and therefore has no way to reverse a transaction.â€¨Please be careful and always double check that you are sending the correct token to the correct address.
